          Your Fortune Is In Prayer But In The Prayers Of Others. One Day A Man
          Went To Him And Said, I Am In A Lot Of Trouble. He Said The Solution
          Is Simple, Find A Man Who Will Pray For You But On The Condition That
          You Don't Ask Him To Pray For You. Pray For You Just By Seeing You. So
          Do Something For Someone To Pray For You.
